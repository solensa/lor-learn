      A learning path is an ideal sequence of learning activities that drives a learner to reach
      proficiency in their chosen job or capability in the shortest possible time, by looking at
      learning as a complete process rather than a single event. The following are learning paths
      made by subject matter experts in Laing O'Rourke, specifically for us!
